    Per layer M ~ U V^T with V (K x r) orthonormal and U (N x r): M <- beta*M + g, kept at rank
    r by one subspace-iteration step (two thin GEMMs + a QR, no SVD). The flip rule and rate
    are unchanged; only its signal is the accumulated direction. State: r*(N+K) floats/layer.

    adapt: the decay follows the turn of the gradient, beta_t = beta * cos(g_t, M_{t-1}) per
    layer. Aligned: plain momentum; 90 deg: reset (M = g); 180 deg: -beta, so the old momentum
    is reflected onto the new direction and adds to it. Returns the per-layer cosines.

    speed_ref: (--speed_ref B) divide M by a slow EMA (decay B) of its mean |M| instead of by this step's mean |M|,
            so the number of flips follows the momentum's size (it drops when the new gradients cancel it while
            climbing a wall) instead of staying fixed. One float per layer.

    ncap / pfun_tanh (the user's rule, with beta = 1: momentum as one velocity vector, gravity = the gradient):
            ncap C caps the whole momentum (all layers as one vector) at C x a slow EMA of the total gradient norm;
            pfun_tanh S sets the flip chance to rate * tanh(|M_ij| / (g_ref v0)), v0 = S x a slow EMA of the layer's
            mean |g| (absolute gradient units, not the momentum's own size). Two floats + one per layer.

    undo: (--undo) a corrective move: last step's flips that this batch's gradient and the updated momentum now both
            call uphill are flipped back before this step's flips (the last step's moves are kept for one step,
            2 bits per weight packed, like the gradient itself a one-step buffer).
    grav_up: (--grav_up D) asymmetric gravity: where this batch's gradient opposes a weight's momentum (climbing), that
            weight's momentum decays with D instead of beta; on the full M, then one subspace step back to rank r.

    slow_rank / slow_beta: (--slow_gate R) a second, slow momentum (rank R, decay slow_beta) kept like M; flip only
            where the fast and the slow momentum agree in sign (a long-horizon consistency gate). R*(N+K) floats.
    dither: (--dither_ld) the flip draw is a low-discrepancy sequence per weight, u_ij = frac(h_ij + step * phi) with
            h_ij a fixed hash of the weight (regenerated each step from a seed, not stored), instead of a fresh random
            number: each weight flips its expected number of times with little sampling noise. No state.
    dry_start / dry_warm: (--dry_start D0 --dry_warm N) a memory that starts short and lengthens: the friction goes from D0
            (strong: short memory) to dry_vec over the first N steps on a cosine, then stays at dry_vec.
    dry_vec: (--dry_vec D) dry friction on the whole momentum (all layers as one vector): after each step
            ||M|| -= D x a slow EMA of the total gradient norm (to 0), use with beta 1. Two floats.
    dry_w: (--dry_w D) dry friction per weight: |M_ij| -= D x the layer's mean |g| each step (to 0), on the full M,
            then one subspace step back to rank r (like grav_up); use with beta 1.
    rare_rank / rare_dry / rare_mode: (--rare_rank R) a second momentum for rare patterns: rank R, fed only the part of
            each gradient outside the main momentum's column space, g2 = g - (g V) V^T, with its own, weaker dry
            friction (--rare_dry, so a longer memory; decay 1). rare_mode "sum": the flip signal is M + M2; "flip": M2
            proposes its own flips after the main ones, at rare_rate x the flip rate, with the same Adam step and gate.
    tiers: (--tiers "R:D,R:D,...") generalises rare_rank to a chain: tier t is fed what the main momentum and tiers
            0..t-1 miss (the residual after projecting out each one's column space in turn), has rank R and its own dry
            friction D (each later tier usually weaker = longer memory); combined as rare_mode (sum / own flips).
    rare_weight: (--rare_weight w, with rare_mode sum) add each extra momentum at w x the main one's mean size instead of
            at its own size: M + w (mean|M| / mean|M_t|) M_t, so a long-memory extra momentum cannot outgrow and swamp the
            main one. Logs the raw size ratio mean|M_t| / mean|M| (first tier) as rare_ratio.
    pshape: (--pshape) which weights the flips go to, at the same expected number of flips as the usual rule (p ~
            min(|S| / (3 mean|S|), 1)), same direction (-sign S) and the same gate: "flat" every eligible weight equally
            likely (sign only); "inv" preferring the small |S|: p ~ 1 - min(|S| / (3 mean|S|), 1); "cheap" preferring
            weights with a small gradient second moment v = R_i C_j / mean R (the Adam step's factors): p ~ 1 / (1 + v /
            median v). With pshape_T > 0 (--pshape_sched cos) the flips are a blend that moves from the usual rule to the
            chosen shape over training: p = (1 - lam) p_prop + lam p_shape, lam = (1 - cos(pi t / T)) / 2, both at the
            same expected count (steep weights first, cheap ones at the end). Master changes the weights nearest a rounding boundary, evenly across gradient sizes; the usual
            rule piles its flips on the steepest weights, where many flips together overshoot (1 Oct bench).
    mom_int8: (--mom_int8) store the momentum factors U, V at 8 bits: after each step every column is rounded
            stochastically to 255 levels of its own absmax (per-column fp32 scale), so the next step reads what an int8
            store would hold. Measures the precision cost; the memory itself is not yet packed.
    spend: (--spend c, plain path) a flip consumes the push that caused it: U += c * mean|M| * (D V), D = the trits'
            change (-sign(M) where they flipped), so those entries of M shrink by c * mean|M| (kept low-rank).

    propose_only: update M but do not flip; leave l.gw and capture on and return the M's,
    so lookahead_step proposes from M and filters with the true gradients.

    diag: also log, per step, how M_{t-1} relates to this step's gradient g: mean |g|, mean |M|,
